       <p style="text-align:center; padding: 30px;">hey there! this site works fine without javascript; every animation i could implement in pure css i did so.
        but the site will look a little nicer and work a little better if you turn js on. learn more about my js philosophy here.</p>

        <h2 id="lede-h2">Hi. I'm Logan.</h2>
        <h3 class="lede-h3">I make <span style="font-family: La Belle Aurore">beautiful, personal sites</span> for people who want a home on the internet.</h3>
        <p class="lede-p">
            Personal sites are the digital world's soft underbelly — amidst the churning mass of algorithmic slop there are scattered oases, peopled by personal websites, anon blogs, side projects, side-projects-that-turned-main-projects; it's organic, hand-made in the way much of the surface-level internet isn't.
            <br><br>
            My mission is to make that web more accessible — and more beautiful.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="lede-h3">Wait, so... what exactly do you do?</h3>
        <p class="lede-p"> 
            I build personal sites: arenas for self expression, digital gardents, mirrors to the people they represent. It's not easy to pin down because everyone's website is different — and that's the beauty of it.<br> <br></p>
             <p class="lede-p" style="font-family: La Belle Aurore; font-size: 25pt; text-align: center;">Websites are for anyone and everyone.</p> <p class="lede-p">For some it's a page to showcase their work; for others it's a space to write, or to fool around with code; for still others a personal website is just a central node connecting their various identities on the internet.<br><br>I work with clients step-by-step to figure out <i>what they care about</i> and <i>how that comes to life</i> in the aesthetics of a webpage. 
            <br> <br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="lede-h3">What's your process?</h3>

        <ol class="lede-p"> 
            <li>Fill out <a href="form">the intro form</a>.</li>
            <li>Get me a sample of the vibe. Compile a sample of things you like — your aesthetics — in a google doc, Pinterest moodboard, markdown file, whatever you prefer. 
                <br>  <br>This can be images, screenshots of other websites, verbal descriptors e.g. "fancy medieval documents," "looks like a newspaper," "feels like a garden," "retro 1990s/atari," "academic," etc. — and tell me what you want to do with it. Showcase projects? Post essays? Just host an about page with links out to other sites?<br>  <br>If you have layout preferences lmk too — really out there layouts are cool, and so are well-executed traditional ones!</li>
            <li>I'll come up with a mockup or multiple, depending on how much you gave me to go off of; we can talk through what you think, change directions, refine.</li>
            <li>Once we're set on a design, we can pick a platform/static site generator that fits your use case and I'll build the site!</li>
